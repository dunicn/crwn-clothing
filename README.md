# crwn-clothing
This is an e-commerce web application that allows users to buy clothes and accessories. Users can sign up with e-mail or using their linked google accounts. They can choose between many different items sorted in collections. Users are able to simple add items to cart, and after they are done, they can proceed to the checkout page and finish their simulated shopping by paying for chosen items.
